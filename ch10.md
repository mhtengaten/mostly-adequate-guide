# Applicative Functors

## It's in the name

The name **applicative functor** should spill the beans on what this interface give us: the ability to apply one functor to another.

Now, why would a normal, rational person, such as yourself, want such a thing? What does it even *mean* to apply a functor to one of its own?

To answer these questions, we'll start with a situation you may have very well encountered already in your functional travels. Let's say, hypothetically, we have two functors (of the same type) and we'd like to call a function with both of their values as arguments. Something simple like adding the values of two `Container`s.

```js
// we can't do this because the values are wrapped up.
add(Container.of(2), Container.of(3));
//NaN

// Let's map!
var container_of_add_2 = map(add, Container.of(2));
// Container(add(2))
```

Well, well. We have ourselves a `Container` with a function inside. Now, we can `chain` and `map` this partially applied `add(2)` manually like so:

```js
container_of_add_2.chain(function(add2) {
  return Container.of(3).map(add2);
});
```

But it would be lovely if we could simply apply one functor's function contents[^Say that 5 times fast] to another's value. Enter `ap`.

```js
container_of_add_2.ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)
```

There we are, nice and neat. We can define `ap` like so:

```js
Container.prototype.ap = function(other_container) {
  return other_container.map(this.__value);
}
```

Remember, `this.__value` will be a function and we'll be accepting another container so we need only `map` it.

Now, I sense your skepticism, but keep an open mind, this `ap` character will prove useful. For starters, we can take any curried function of more than 1 argument and apply it to more than 1 functor all within a functor's context:

```js
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe.of(2)).ap(Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

Task.of(add).ap(Task.of(2)).ap(Task.of(3));
// Task(5)

//  signIn :: String -> String -> Bool -> User
var signIn = curry(function(username, password, remember_me){ /* signing in */  })

IO.of(signIn).ap(IO.of('gg')).ap(IO.of('allin')).ap(IO.of(false));
// IO(user)

var validate = curry(function(email, name) { });
Either.of(validate).ap(checkEmail(user)).ap(checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email, invalid name")

var generateReport = curry(function(users, pages, views) { /* report junk */  });
Task.of(generateReport).ap(Db.all('users')).ap(Db.all('pages')).ap(Db.all('views'))
// Report({})
```

The pattern is to **lift** a function into the type with `of`, then `ap` until it receives all arguments. What happens behind the curtain is our function gets partially applied each time we call `ap` and the effects of our functor, be it async, null checks, etc, will be carried throughout the application.

This ability to work with multiple functors was already available with monads, however, with applicatives we aren't applying step-by-step nested computations. If we `ap` two `Tasks`, they will kick off immediately instead of waiting for the first to finish as was the case with monadic chaining.

Another big differences is that it doesn't stop and throw its hands up at the first sign of failure. In the validation example above using `Either`, both validations will run even if the first returns a `Left`. Contrast this with the monadic verison:

```js

validate
Either.of(validate


```js
map(add(1), Container(2));
// Container(3)

map(add, Container(2));
// Container(add(2))
-```


```js
Container.of(add(1)).ap(Container(2))
// Container(3)

Container.of(add).ap(Container(1)).ap(Container(2))

Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(1)).ap(Maybe(2))
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(null)).ap(Maybe(2))

Maybe.of(befriend).ap(Maybe(user1)).ap(Maybe(user2))

// save has to be curried.
Task.of(save).ap(readFile).ap()
```

- buzzy lament of dying bees
- This is the kind of beautiful code that takes us one step closer to the singularity
- It all plays together in an electric harmony like if Mozart traded in his harpsichord for a keytar (on cat theory)
- Like a cardboard cutout of your best friend, it's no replacement
- Like Darth Vader at a drive thru it's not so clear
- We're just spinning gold like rumplestilskin
