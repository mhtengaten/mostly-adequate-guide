# Applicative Functors

## It's in the name

The name **applicative functor** should spill the beans on what this interface give us: *the ability to apply one functor to another*.

Now, why would a normal, rational person, such as yourself, want such a thing? What does it even *mean* to apply a functor to another?

To answer these questions, we'll start with a situation you may have already encountered in your functional travels. Let's say, hypothetically, that we have two functors (of the same type) and we'd like to call a function with both of their values as arguments. Something simple like adding the values of two `Container`s.

```js
// we can't do this because the numbers are bottled up.
add(Container.of(2), Container.of(3));
//NaN

// Let's use our trusty map
var container_of_add_2 = map(add, Container.of(2));
// Container(add(2))
```

We have ourselves a `Container` with a partially applied function inside. More specifically, we have a `Container(add(2))` and we'd like to apply this to our `Container(3)`. Well well, we'd like to apply one functor to another.

Now, we can `chain` and `map` this partially applied `add(2)` manually like so:

```js
Container.of(2).chain(function(two) {
  return Container.of(3).map(add(two));
});
```

The issue here is that we are stuck in the sequential world of monads wherein nothing may be evaluated until the previous monad has finished its business. We have ourselves two strong, independent values and I should think it unnecessary to delay the creation of `Container.of(3)` merely to satisfy the monad's wishes.

In fact, it would be lovely if we could simply apply one functor's contents to another's value should we find ourselves in this pickle jar. Enter `ap`.

```js
Container.of(add(2)).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)

// all together now
Container.of(2).map(add).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)
```

There we are, nice and neat and `Container(3)` will exist outside of a nested monadic function. We can define `ap` like so:

```js
Container.prototype.ap = function(other_container) {
  return other_container.map(this.__value);
}
```

Remember, `this.__value` will be a function and we'll be accepting another container so we need only `map` it. And with that we have our interface definition:


> An *applicative functor* is a pointed functor with an `ap` method

Note the dependence on **pointed**. Now, I sense your skepticism (or perhaps confusion and horror), but keep an open mind, this `ap` character will prove useful. Before we get into it, let's explore a nice property.

```js
F.of(x).map(f) === F.of(f).ap(F.of(x))
```

In proper English, mapping `f` is equivalent to `ap`ing a functor of `f`. This allows us to write in a more linear fashion:

```js
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe.of(2)).ap(Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

Task.of(add).ap(Task.of(2)).ap(Task.of(3));
// Task(5)
```

One might even recognise the vague shape of a normal function call if viewed mid squint. We'll look at pointfree version later in the chapter, but for now, this is the preferred way to write such code. Using `of`, each value gets transported to the magical land of containers, this parallel universe where each application can be async or null or what have you.

Did you see, we used `Task` in the previous example? This is a prime example of where applicative functors pull their weight. Let's look at a more in-depth example.

Say, we're building a travel site and we'd like to retrieve both a list of tourist destinations and separately, a list of local events.

```js
// Http.get :: String -> Task(Error, HTML)

var renderPage = curry(function(destinations, events) { /* render page */  });
Task.of(renderPage).ap(Http.get('/destinations')).ap(Http.get('/events'))
// Task("<div>some page with dest and events</div>")
```

Both `Http` calls will happen instantly and `renderPage` will be called when both are resolved. Contrast this with the monadic version where one `Task` must finish before the next fires off. Since we don't need the destinations to retrieve events, this is a good move performance-wise.

Now because we're using partial application to achieve this result, we must ensure `renderPage` is curried or it will not wait for both `Tasks` to finish. Incidentally, if you've ever had to do such a thing manually, you'll appreciate the astonishing simplicity of this interface. This is the kind of beautiful code that takes us one step closer to the singularity.

Let's look at another example.

```js
//  signIn :: String -> String -> Bool -> User
var signIn = curry(function(username, password, remember_me){ /* signing in */  })


// assuming $ returns an IO
IO.of(signIn).ap($('#email')).ap($('#password')).ap(IO.of(false));
// IO({id: 3, email: "gg@allin.com"})
```

`signIn` is a curried function of 3 arguments so we have to `ap` that many times. We can continue this pattern with as many arguments as necessary, though I think more than 3 gets a tad excessive. Two end up naturally in `IO`s whereas the last needs `of` to lift it.

Again, The key difference from monads is that both dom elements are found immediately (well, the `IO`s are created immediately anyways) and we don't have to work sequentially.

## Bro, do you even lift?

Let's examine a pointfree way to write this.

```js
var validate = curry(function(email, name) { });
Either.of(validate).ap(checkEmail(user)).ap(checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email")

liftA2(validate, ch
```

The pattern is to **lift** a function into the type with `of`, then `ap` until it receives all arguments. What happens behind the curtain is our function gets partially applied each time we call `ap` and the effects of our functor, be it async, null checks, etc, will be carried throughout the application.

This ability to work with multiple functors was already available with monads, however, with applicatives we aren't applying step-by-step nested computations. If we `ap` two `Tasks`, they will kick off immediately instead of waiting for the first to finish as was the case with monadic chaining.

Another big differences is that it doesn't stop and throw its hands up at the first sign of failure. In the validation example above using `Either`, both validations will run even if the first returns a `Left`. Contrast this with the monadic verison:

```js

validate
Either.of(validate


```js
map(add(1), Container(2));
// Container(3)

map(add, Container(2));
// Container(add(2))
-```

```js

liftA2(save, getUser, readFile)
```

Functional programmers are notorious for coming up with names like `liftA2`, which seems perfectly natural when viewed via chalk in the mathlab, yet, in any other context it holds the clarity of darth vader at a drive thru intercom.

```js
map(add(1), Container(2));
// Container(3)

map(add, Container(2));
// Container(add(2))
-```

```js
Container.of(add(1)).ap(Container(2))
// Container(3)

Container.of(add).ap(Container(1)).ap(Container(2))

Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(1)).ap(Maybe(2))
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(null)).ap(Maybe(2))

Maybe.of(befriend).ap(Maybe(user1)).ap(Maybe(user2))

// save has to be curried.
Task.of(save).ap(readFile).ap()
```

- buzzy lament of dying bees
- This is the kind of beautiful code that takes us one step closer to the singularity
- It all plays together in an electric harmony like if Mozart traded in his harpsichord for a keytar (on cat theory)
- Like a cardboard cutout of your best friend, it's no replacement
- Like Darth Vader at a drive thru it's not so clear
- We're just spinning gold like rumplestilskin
