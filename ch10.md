# Applicative Functors

## Applying Applicatives

The name **applicative functor** is pleasantly descriptive given it's functional origins. Functional programmers are notorious for coming up with names like `mappend` or `liftA4`, which seem perfectly natural when viewed via chalk in the math lab, but in any other context hold the clarity of an indecisive darth vader at the drive thru.

Anyhow, the name should spill the beans on what this interface give us: *the ability to apply functors to each other*.

Now, why would a normal, rational person, such as yourself, want such a thing? What does it even *mean* to apply a functor to another?

To answer these questions, we'll start with a situation you may have already encountered in your functional travels. Let's say, hypothetically, that we have two functors (of the same type) and we'd like to call a function with both of their values as arguments. Something simple like adding the values of two `Container`s.

```js
// we can't do this because the numbers are bottled up.
add(Container.of(2), Container.of(3));
//NaN

// Let's use our trusty map
var container_of_add_2 = map(add, Container.of(2));
// Container(add(2))
```

We have ourselves a `Container` with a partially applied function inside. More specifically, we have a `Container(add(2))` and we'd like to apply its `add(2)` to the `3` in `Container(3)` to complete the call. In other words, we'd like to apply one functor to another.

Now, it just so happens we already have the tools to accomplish this task. We can `chain` and then `map` the partially applied `add(2)` like so:

```js
Container.of(2).chain(function(two) {
  return Container.of(3).map(add(two));
});
```

The issue here is that we are stuck in the sequential world of monads wherein nothing may be evaluated until the previous monad has finished its business. We have ourselves two strong, independent values and I should think it unnecessary to delay the creation of `Container(3)` merely to satisfy the monad's sequential demands.

In fact, it would be lovely if we could succinctly apply one functor's contents to another's value without these needless functions and variables should we find ourselves in this pickle jar.


## Ap

![http://hollycarden.deviantart.com/](http://localhost:8000/images/ship_in_a_bottle.jpg)

`ap` is a function that can apply the function contents of one functor to the value contents of another. Say that 5 times fast.

```js
Container.of(add(2)).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)

// all together now
Container.of(2).map(add).ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)
```

There we are, nice and neat. Good news for `Container(3)` as it's been set free from the jail of the nested monadic function. It's worth mentioning again that `add` in this case gets partially applied during the first `map` so this only works when `add` is curried.

We can define `ap` like so:

```js
Container.prototype.ap = function(other_container) {
  return other_container.map(this.__value);
}
```

Remember, `this.__value` will be a function and we'll be accepting another functor so we need only `map` it. And with that we have our interface definition:


> An *applicative functor* is a pointed functor with an `ap` method

Note the dependence on **pointed**. The pointed interface is crucial here as we'll see throughout the following examples.

Now, I sense your skepticism (or perhaps confusion and horror), but keep an open mind; this `ap` character will prove useful. Before we get into it, let's explore a nice property.

```js
F.of(x).map(f) == F.of(f).ap(F.of(x))
```

In proper English, mapping `f` is equivalent to `ap`ing a functor of `f`. Or in properer English, we can place `x` into our container and `map(f)` OR we can lift both `f` and `x` into our container and `ap` them. This allows us to write in a left-to-right fashion:

```js
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe.of(2)).ap(Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

Task.of(add).ap(Task.of(2)).ap(Task.of(3));
// Task(5)
```

One might even recognise the vague shape of a normal function call if viewed mid squint. We'll look at pointfree version later in the chapter, but for now, this is the preferred way to write such code. Using `of`, each value gets transported to the magical land of containers, this parallel universe where each application can be async or null or what have you and `ap` will apply functions within this fantastical place. It's like building a ship in a bottle.

Did you see there? We used `Task` in our example. This is a prime situation where applicative functors pull their weight. Let's look at a more in-depth example.

## Motivation

Say we're building a travel site and we'd like to retrieve both a list of tourist destinations and local events. Each of these are separate, stand alone api calls.

```js
// Http.get :: String -> Task Error HTML

var renderPage = curry(function(destinations, events) { /* render page */  });

Task.of(renderPage).ap(Http.get('/destinations')).ap(Http.get('/events'))
// Task("<div>some page with dest and events</div>")
```

Both `Http` calls will happen instantly and `renderPage` will be called when both are resolved. Contrast this with the monadic version where one `Task` must finish before the next fires off. Since we don't need the destinations to retrieve events, we are free from sequential evaluation.

Again because we're using partial application to achieve this result, we must ensure `renderPage` is curried or it will not wait for both `Tasks` to finish. Incidentally, if you've ever had to do such a thing manually, you'll appreciate the astonishing simplicity of this interface. This is the kind of beautiful code that takes us one step closer to the singularity.

Let's look at another example.

```js
// Helpers:
// ==============
//  $ :: String -> IO DOM
var $ = function(selector) {
  return new IO(function(){ return document.querySelector(selector) });
}

//  getVal :: String -> IO String
var getVal = compose(map(_.prop('value')), $);

// Example:
// ===============
//  signIn :: String -> String -> Bool -> User
var signIn = curry(function(username, password, remember_me){ /* signing in */  })

IO.of(signIn).ap(getVal('#email')).ap(getVal('#password')).ap(IO.of(false));
// IO({id: 3, email: "gg@allin.com"})
```

`signIn` is a curried function of 3 arguments so we have to `ap` accordingly. With each `ap` it `signIn` receives one more argument until it is complete and runs. We can continue this pattern with as many arguments as necessary. Another thing to note is that two arguments end up naturally in `IO` whereas the last one needs a little help from `of` to lift it into `IO` since `ap` expects the function and all its arguments to be in the same type.

## Bro, do you even lift?

Let's examine a pointfree way to write these applicative calls. Since we know `map` is equal to `of/ap`, we can write generic functions that will `ap` as many times as we specify:

```js
var liftA2 = curry(function(f, functor1, functor2) {
  return functor1.map(f).ap(functor2);
});

var liftA3 = curry(function(f, functor1, functor2, functor3) {
  return functor1.map(f).ap(functor2).ap(functor3);
});

//liftA4, etc
```

`liftA2` is a strange name. It sounds like one of the finicky freight elevators in a rundown factory or a vanity plate for a cheap limo company. Once enlightened, however, it's self explanatory: lift these pieces into the applicative functor world.

When I first saw this 2-3-4 nonsense it struck me as ugly and unnecessary, after all, we can check arity of functions in JavaScript and build this up dynamically. However, it is often useful to partially apply `liftA(N)` itself, so it cannot vary in argument length.

Let's see this in use:

```js
//  createUser :: String -> String -> IO User
var createUser = curry(function(email, name) { /* creating... */ });

Either.of(createUser).ap(checkEmail(user)).ap(checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email")

liftA2(createUser, checkEmail(user), checkName(user));
// Left("invalid email")
```

Since `createUser` takes two arguments, we use the corresponding `liftA2`. The two statements are equivalent, but the `liftA2` version has no mention of `Either`. This makes it more generic and flexible since we are no longer married to a specific type.


Let's see the previous examples written this way:

```js
liftA2(add, Maybe.of(2), Maybe.of(3));
// Maybe(5)

liftA2(renderPage, Http.get('/destinations'), Http.get('/events'))
// Task("<div>some page with dest and events</div>")

liftA3(signIn, getVal('#email'), getVal('#password'), IO.of(false));
// IO({id: 3, email: "gg@allin.com"})
```


# Operators

In languages like haskell, scala, PureScript, and swift, it is possible to create your own infix operators like `+` and `*`. You may see syntax like this:

```hs
add <$> Right 2 <*> Right 3
```

It's helpful to know that `<$>` is `map` (aka `fmap`) and `<*>` is just `ap`. This allows for a more natural function application style and can help remove some parenthesis.


# Laws

Like the other mathematical constructs we've explored, applicative functors hold some useful properties for us to rely on in our daily code. First off, you should know that applicatives are "closed under composition", meaning `ap` will never change container types on us. That's not to say we cannot have multiple different effects - we can stack functors knowing that our stack will remain the same during the entirety of our application.

The beauty in using these interfaces is that they all play together in perfect computational harmony like if Mozart torrented ableton.

```js
// identity
A.of(id).ap(v) == v
```

Right, so applying `id` all from within a functor shouldn't alter the value in `v`. For example:

```js
Identity.of(id).ap(Identity.of("Pillow Pets")) == Identity.of("Pillow Pets")
// Identity("Pillow Pets")
```

What's interesting is that, as we've already established, `of/ap` is the same as `map` so this law follows directly from functor identity: `map(id) == id`. Incidentally, `Identity.of(id)` makes me chuckle at it's futility.

The next law is *homomorphism*. A *homomorphism* is just a structure preserving map (think distributivity). In fact, a functor is just a *homomorphism* between categories as it preserves the original category's structure under the mapping. We're really just stuffing our normal functions and values into a container and running the computation in there so it should come as no surprise that we will end up with the same result if we apply the whole thing inside the container (left side of the equation) or apply it outside, then place it in there (right side).

```js
// homomorphism
A.of(f).ap(A.of(x)) == A.of(f(x))
```

Just to show an example:

```js
Maybe.of(_.toUpper).ap(Maybe.of("oreos")) == Maybe.of(R.toUpper("oreos"))
// Maybe("OREOS")
```

The *interchange* states that it doesn't matter if we choose to lift the left or right side of `ap` into our functor using `of` since it will all work out to the same thing. This makes sense if you consider `of` to be a harmless (pure) way to bottle something up.

```js
// interchange
v.ap(A.of(x)) == A.of(function(f) { return f(x) }).ap(v)
```

Here is an example:

```js
var v = Task.of(R.toUpper);
v.ap(Task.of('hi')) == Task.of(function(f) { return f(x) }).ap(v)
// Task('HI')
```

And finally composition which is just a way to check that our standard functor composition holds with this new fangled `ap`.

```js
// composition
A.of(compose).ap(u).ap(v).ap(w) == u.ap(v.ap(w));
```

```js
IO.of(compose).ap(IO.of(_.toUpper)).ap(IO.of(_.last)).ap(IO.of("yo"))
// IO.of(compose(_.toUpper, _.last, "yo"))
// O
// IO.of(_.toUpper).ap(IO.of(_.last).ap(IO.of("yo")))
// O
```
