# Applicative Functors

## It's in the name

The name **applicative functor** should spill the beans on what this interface give us: the ability to apply one functor to another.

Now, why would a normal, rational person, such as yourself, want such a thing? What does it even *mean* to apply a functor to one of its own?

To answer these questions, we'll start with a situation you may have very well encountered already in your functional travels. Let's say, hypothetically, we have two functors (of the same type) and we'd like to call a function with both of their values as arguments. Something simple like adding the values of two `Container`s.

```js
// we can't do this because the values are wrapped up.
add(Container.of(2), Container.of(3));
//NaN

// Let's map!
var container_of_add_2 = map(add, Container.of(2));
// Container(add(2))
```

Well, well. We have ourselves a `Container` with a function inside. Now, we can `chain` and `map` this partially applied `add(2)` manually like so:

```js
container_of_add_2.chain(function(add2) {
  return Container.of(3).map(add2);
});
```

But it would be lovely if we could simply apply one functor's function contents[^Say that 5 times fast] to another's value. Enter `ap`.

```js
container_of_add_2.ap(Container.of(3));
// Container(5)
```

There we are, nice and neat. We can define `ap` like so:

```js
Container.prototype.ap = function(other_container) {
  return other_container.map(this.__value);
}
```

Remember, `this.__value` will be a function and we'll be accepting another container so we need only `map` it.

Now, I sense your skepticism, but keep an open mind, this `ap` character will prove useful. For starters, we can take any curried function of more than 1 argument and apply it to more than 1 functor:

```js
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe.of(2)).ap(Maybe.of(3));
// Container(5)

var saveEntry = curry(function(text, user) { });
IO.of().ap($('#text_area')).ap(currentUser());
// Container(5)

var generateReport = curry(function(users, pages, views) { /* report junk */  });
Task.of(generateReport).ap(Db.all('users')).ap(Db.all('pages')).ap(Db.all('views'))
// Report({})
```

Now 



```js
map(add(1), Container(2));
// Container(3)

map(add, Container(2));
// Container(add(2))
-```


```js
Container.of(add(1)).ap(Container(2))
// Container(3)

Container.of(add).ap(Container(1)).ap(Container(2))

Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(1)).ap(Maybe(2))
Maybe.of(add).ap(Maybe(null)).ap(Maybe(2))

Maybe.of(befriend).ap(Maybe(user1)).ap(Maybe(user2))

// save has to be curried.
Task.of(save).ap(readFile).ap()
```
